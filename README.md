<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Alex Nord,  I'm 35 years old. I've worked in web development since 2005. I speak English and Swedish, as well as some Spanish.</p>
<p>I started my web development career in e-commerce. Prior to working professionally, I'd been writing code for many years. A few years into my career, I decided to specialize in WordPress and WooCommerce. I've used PHP for about 20 years now and it's one of my favorite programming languages.</p>
<p>JavaScript, React and Tailwind CSS are my favorite tools for frontend development. I am also very interested in network infrastructure, load balancing and scaling. I'm a huge advocate for containerization, serverless functions and Kubernetes.</p>
