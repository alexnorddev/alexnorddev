<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Alex Nord and I'm 35 years old. I've worked as a developer/programmer since 2005.</p>
<p>I speak fluent English and Swedish, as well as some Spanish.</p>
<p>My web development career started with HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. Before WordPress was popular, I was writing my own content managing systems. I eventually decided to specialise in WordPress plugin and theme development.</p>
<p>JavaScript and PHP are my favorite programming languages. React is my favorite frontend framework. I use Node.js and Express to write backend APIs.</p>
<p>Because code needs somewhere to run, I am also very interested in network infrastructure, load balancing and scaling. I'm a huge advocate for containerization, serverless functions and Kubernetes.</p>

<h2>Frontend development</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>My primary programming language for frontend applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>React - framework (reactjs.org)</h3>
    <p>React is my frontend-framework of choice. I use it to create highly interactive and performant user experiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Next - React framework (nextjs.org)</h3>
    <p>Next is a React framework that I use for new projects. It allows me to configure and start prototyping a new project in minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Tailwind CSS - CSS framework (tailwindcss.com)</h3>
    <p>Tailwind is a CSS framework that I use instead of writing CSS rules. It speeds up development, decreases page load time and makes it easier to collaborate with other developers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Framer Motion - React animation framework (framer.com/motion)</h3>
    <p>Framer Motion is an animation library for React that I use instead of CSS animations. It allows me to smoothly animate any CSS property and create effects that just would not be possible otherwise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Backend development</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>My primary programming language for frontend applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Node</h3>
    <p>I use Node as the backend of new projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Express</h3>
    <p>Express is what I use to build APIs for new backends. I write my own middleware for authentication and such.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>MySQL</h3>
    <p>I like relational databases more than the alternatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>I have worked as Django and Python developer for a SaaS company, but I would prefer to never write Python again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>WordPress</h3>
    <p>WordPress development was, for a long time, my sole occupation. I can create plugins and themes that extend WordPress functionality however I want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>WooCommerce (WordPress plugin)</h3>
    <p>Years and years of experience building e-commerce websites with WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Advanced Custom Fields (WordPress plugin)</h3>
    <p>Advanced Custom Fields is the most commonly used tool of trade for WordPress developers and I have plenty of experience using it. I like to include it in my themes and register all my custom fields in code, rather than using the UI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>PHP</h3>
    <p>PHP was one of my first programming languages. I used to work exclusively with WordPress websites for many years, which is where most of my PHP experience comes from.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Github</h3>
    <p>I really like using Github and Github actions for automatic deployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>DevOps</h3>
    <p>I use Github actions and webhooks for continous deployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>CI/CD</h3>
    <p>I use Github actions and webhooks for continous deployment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Docker</h3>
    <p>I am a huge advocate for containerization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
    <p>The best way to deploy containers. There is definetly a learning curve, but once you know it... Amazing.</p>
